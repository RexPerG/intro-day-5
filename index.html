        <h2 class="h2">by Ron Burgundy?</h2>
        <p>I’m not quite sure how to put this, but… I’m kind of a big deal… I’m very important. I have many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Okay, before we start, let’s go over the ground rules. No touching of the hair or face. And that’s it.</h2>
        <h3 id="words-of-wisdom">Words of Wisdom</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I have very little time to get to the gym, so I have to sculpt my guns at the office.</li>
            <li>I could be wrong, but I believe 'diversity' is an old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era.</li>
            <li>I believe it's jogging. Or yogging, it might be a soft J. I'm not sure, but apparently you just run for an extended period of time. It's supposed to be wild</li>
            <li>It's so damn hot . . . milk was a bad choice!</li>
            <li>If you want to throw down in fisticuffs, fine, I’ve got Jack Johnson and Tom O’Leary waitin’ for ya…right here!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Other things</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mmm. I look good. I mean, really good. Hey, everyone! Come and see how good I look!</li>
            <li>I love scotch. Scotchy scotch scotch. Here it goes down, down into my belly.</li>
            <li>I'm in a glass case of emotions.</li>
            <li>By the beard of Zeus!</li>
            <li>Great Odin's raven!</li>
            <li>Don't act like you're not impressed.</li>
        </ol>
